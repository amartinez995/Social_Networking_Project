        Social networks earned an estimated 8.3 billion dollars from advertising in 2015 alone, and 40 billion was spent on social media advertising in 2016; however, only 20 out of 500 companies engage with their customers on Facebook. On Twitter, 78% of people complaining about a product expected a response within the hour; however, 96% of people who bring up a certain brand don’t actually follow said brand on social media at all.

            <h1>Impact of Social Media on Businesses & Conclusions</h1>
            <p>In the present day of social media and any place of social networking you are guaranteed to see at least
                one
                advertisement about some product you should buy. If you have Facebook, you will get an advertisement
                for
                something that you recently shopped for, looked at on Amazon, or even based on your web searches.
                Social
                media
                has helped a huge amount of small companies. An article from MIS Quarterly Executive stated, “500 to
                very
                small
                businesses, achieving and measuring business value from social media continues to pose challenges to
                many
                organizations.” The statistics show that in this day and age, companies are now more confident than
                ever;
                with
                more companies turning to social media platforms rather than commercials. MIS Quarterly Executive also
                stated,
                “64% used Web 2.0 platforms internally, 56% to communicate with customers, and 40% to work with
                external
                partners or suppliers.”

                Social networking can have many benefits, but it also has just as many dangers. It has helped people
                the
                world over stay connected on a global and convenient scale, but that has also led to sexual
                exploitation,
                cyberbullying, unwanted harassment, etc. Yet, despite all the clear dangers and obvious risks, social
                media
                continues to be so popular, because it’s easy and convenient. Take, for example, Facebook. Facebook has
                had
                their user data privacy breached so many times, yet a shocking number of people continue using that
                platform to stay connected with the people they know; however, the benefits seem to outweigh the
                dangers,
                for now.
